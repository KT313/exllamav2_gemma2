DEPRECATION: Loading egg at /home/tobias/miniconda3/envs/convert_llm/lib/python3.11/site-packages/hqq_aten-0.0.0-py3.11-linux-x86_64.egg is deprecated. pip 24.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use pip for package installation.. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12330
